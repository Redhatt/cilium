          PacketTagging describes the specification used by network logging.
          There can be at most one copy of this resource in the cluster.
          This will be enforced using validation proposed in
          https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/issues/1074
          If the resource does not exist, logging will be disabled.
